I am a graduate student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), where I learn about computer science and do research under the supervision of [Jackie C. K. Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) on natural language understanding.

Ultimately, I would like to teach computers how to use language the same way we do, but that's a long way off. In the meantime, I work on language tasks such as [temporal expression recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_expressions), [lexical semantic change detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change) and [coreference resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference). If you have any interesting ideas regarding these tasks, feel free to contact me!
