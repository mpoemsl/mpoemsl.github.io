Hi, I'm Martin.  

I have done some work on natural language generation, lexical semantic change detection and coreference resolution using neural methods. I am especially excited about solving NLP tasks using radically different neural approaches such as [weight-agnostic neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04358), [binarized neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830) and [memory-augmented neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916).  

If you are looking for a collaborator or just want to talk about an idea, feel free to contact me!
