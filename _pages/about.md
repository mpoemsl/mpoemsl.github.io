Hi, I'm Martin.  

I would like to teach computers how to use language the same way we do. To that end, I have worked on natural language generation, lexical semantic change detection and coreference resolution. I am especially excited about approaching NLP tasks using novel neural methods such as [weight-agnostic neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04358), [binarized neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830) or [memory-augmented neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916).  

If you are looking for a collaborator or just want to talk about an idea, feel free to contact me!
