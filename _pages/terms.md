Privacy is an important topic to me. This website is based on a template, which is by default using cookies to store information on your computer. In particular, [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics), a tool that can be used to understand how visitors engage with websites, currently stores cookies on your computer. It reports website trends using cookies without identifying individual visitors. You can read the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) to find more about this.

I will continue to evaluate and restrict the use of cookies on this website as much as possible. For now, if you have any doubts about these cookies, you can disable them through your web browser options. There are instructions on how to do this for [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-websites-storing-cookies-site-data-firefox), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/), and [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-and-manage-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d).
